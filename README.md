#Tutorial: Android App-to-App Calling

This tutorial will walk you through building a simple app-to-app Android calling app. The tutorial is located here: [tutorial.sinch.com/app-app-calling-android](http://tutorial.sinch.com/app-app-calling-android/)

If you want to clone this repo and run the finished app:
- Create an app in the Sinch developer dashboard [sinch.com/dashboard](http://www.sinch.com/dashboard)
- Enter your Sinch app key and secret in CallActivity.java
- Run on two devices or emulators and all each other!

Note: The Sinch SDK is not currently compatible with the Genymotion emulator.
